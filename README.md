# Makemore-Swift
 Andrej Karpathy's [Makemore](https://youtu.be/PaCmpygFfXo) in Swift Playgrounds

These Swift playgrounds are a useful introduction to Swift and playgrounds and also machine learning as well as Metal's MPSGraph API.

The playgrounds will run on a Mac or iPad with the [Playgrounds app](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/).

## Playgrounds

Each example exists as both a playground book with no GUI and a playground App with a SwiftUI GUI.

The playground book format makes it easier to inspect the variables however it is much slower than the SwiftUI App version.
